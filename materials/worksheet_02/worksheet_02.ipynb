    "## Review from worksheet 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic concepts to recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *sampling distribution* is the distribution of a statistic (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion, t-statistic, z-score).\n",
    "    - The sampling distribution is *different from* the sample distribution\n",
    "    - The sampling distribution is *different from* the population distribution\n",
    "        \n",
    "- We need a sampling distribution to make probabilistic statements about our statistic.\n",
    "    - For example: if the population mean is actually 0 (we usually want to test this, you don't know it), what is the probability that the sample mean would be greater than 1?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The problem is that the sampling distribution is usually unknown, mainly because the population distribution is unknown.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You may be able to derive mathematically the sampling distribution if you know the population distribution (rarely in practice).\n",
    "    - For example, if your sample comes from Normal distribution, then the sample mean is Normal as well \n",
    "\n",
    "- In certain cases, you can use results of the CLT if your sample size is large and additional assumptions are met.\n",
    "    - For exmple, for a sample of independent and identically distributed random variables, if the sample size is large, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately Normal\n",
    "    \n",
    "- You can use bootstrapping (although conditions exist as well) to approximate the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors in Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 types of errors in a hypothesis testing problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type I error**: rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type II error**: failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of the type I error is usually called **significance level** (aka $\\alpha$) and it is set by the analyst when designing a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important measure used to design a test is the **power**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power**: the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false (i.e., power = $1 - P(\\text{type II error})$)\n",
    "\n",
    "### $p$-value\n",
    "\n",
    "The $p$-value can be used to assess the significance of the observed results by comparing its value to the specified significance level:\n",
    "   - Is $p < \\alpha$?? \n",
    "\n",
    "But what is a $p$-value?? It's been greatly missused for sure!!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$p$-value**: the probability, under the model specified in $H_0$, that a statistic would be at least as extreme as its observed value \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the $p$-value is **NOT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the probability that $H_0$ is true \n",
    "- the probability that $H_0$ is false\n",
    "- the probability that the statistic observed was produced by random chance alone\n",
    "- a measure of the importance of the observed effect"

    "3. Write a computer script to perform A/B testing optimization with and without using principled peeking.\n",
    "4. Discuss the tradeoff between stopping earlier and certainty of significance, and thereal world implications (e.g., what does the FDA require for early stopping of clinical trials versus Facebook ads optimization?).\n",
    "5. List other questions related to A/B testing optimization that may be relevant in a real data application (e.g., what features cause a Facebook ad to perform best?)"

While this is usually an unrealistic assumption and in practice we use a $t$-test to compare means of two populations, results are nearly equivalent to a $z$-test.

The metholology and implementation are beyond the scope of this course but here's a nice [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJX4W3MwKzU) that explains its key points without too many technical details."

    "\n",
    "1. A/B testing refers to an experiment, in which users are randomly assigned to one of two variations of a product or service: control (A) and variation (B) to see if variation B should be used for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The statistic used to test a hypothesis, the sample size calculation, the type I error rate specification and the desired power are all important and interconnected pieces of the experimental design! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In classical hypothesis testing theory, the sample size must be fixed in advance when the experiment is designed!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modern platforms allow the users to continuously monitor the p-values and confidence intervals of their tests as data are collected (peeking) in order to re-adjust their experiment dynamically. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In particular, users would like to stop their experiments earlier depending on the results of interim analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Naively stopping experiments earlier than planned will increase the probability of *incorrectly* rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., when there is no real effect). Stops must be part of the experimental design and appropriate testing methods must be used!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Sequential testing is just another flavour of a multiple comparison problem. If you make lots of comparisons, but don’t correct for it, your error rates are inflated!! However, in sequential testing tests are nested and not independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. A possible way to control the type I error rated is to use a Bonferroni adjustment of the $p$-values (or equivalently the significance level or critical values). As with other multiple comparison problems, the Bonferroni's correction in sequential analysis is very conservative and can affect the power of the test!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The Pocock's method offers a less conservative way of controlling the type I error rate in sequential testing with early stops.\n",
